title: "Welcome to My Learning Journal"
---

I am a graduate student at Georgia Tech studying Cybersecurity. I'm using this space to journal the things I learn to help me understand things better and maybe even help you learn something new too. 

I will be using my username @minMaxLee as the overall structure for my writings. It will be in three sections - 'min' will be a short summary, a tldr; 'max' will go into some detail and nuances; 'lee' will be some of my thoughts and personal takeaways. 

This blog is a constant work-in-progress and some functionalities may not be working as intended as I play around with certain features.
