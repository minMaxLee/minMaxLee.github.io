Diving into Wireshark ðŸ’»
What a learning curve it was. Lab 1 required me to use Wireshark to look into Internet packets. There was a lot to learn, both in technical skillsâ€”figuring out how to use the toolâ€”and in the fundamental concepts of network communication protocols.

In terms of Wireshark, the filter and statistics features were very helpful for looking for specific information. As for network protocols, I still need to spend some time learning the different layers and the details of each protocol.

A little embarrassingly, I had to search online to find out what the tcp.port filter in Wireshark was doing. I soon realized it was part of the transport layer. It slowly came back to me that different layers had different protocols and communication methods. It became apparent that it was essential to learn how to filter for specific protocols. Within each communication method, some were secured, while others were not.

I learned a great deal through this project. Initially, I felt some imposter syndrome as many of my peers had prior experience with Wireshark, but by the end, I found myself teaching others. This experience helped me realize that consistent effort and a willingness to learn can lead to significant progress.
