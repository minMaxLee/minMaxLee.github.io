### Diving into Assembly 

The first couple of weeks of my Malware Analysis class went deep into **Intel x86 assembly language** and using tools like **IDA Pro** to investigate how malicious code works. This foundational knowledge is crucial for understanding malware's inner workings.

**Assembly language** is a low-level programming language that directly communicates with a computer's processor. It's essential for malware analysis because it's the language that the CPU executes. By reading assembly code, we can see exactly what a program is doing, which is vital for understanding its malicious behavior.

I was surprised by how much I had to focus on the **stack**. Functions like `push`, `pop`, `call`, and `ret` are central to how programs execute. For instance, when a function is called, its arguments and the return address are `push`ed onto the stack. When the function finishes, the `ret` instruction `pop`s the return address, allowing the program to return to where it was before the function call.

Analyzing assembly feels like being a detective, piecing together a story from the raw data of a computer's instructions. It's challenging but incredibly rewarding to trace a program's path and uncover its hidden purpose. This new perspective has deepened my appreciation for the complexity of software and the importance of cybersecurity.
